# Sprite Comparison (OAM Evaluation)

![ppu_locator_sprite_eval](/BreakingNESWiki/imgstore/ppu/ppu_locator_sprite_eval.jpg)

The sprite comparison circuit compares all 64 sprites and selects the first 8 sprites that occur first on the current line (V). The fact that the PPU can only draw the first 8 sprites of a line is a well-known fact that has to be taken into account when programming NES. Usually programmers use sprite shuffling, but even this has the effect of "flickering" sprites.

The selected sprites are placed in additional memory OAM2, from where they then go to [OAM FIFO](fifo.md) for further processing.

The circuit includes:
- OAM index counter, to sample the next sprite for comparison
- OAM2 index counter, to save the comparison results
- Schematics for controlling the counters
- A comparator, which performs a signed subtraction operation (A - B)
- The comparison control circuit which implements the whole logic of sprite comparison operation

## H0'' Auxiliary Circuit

The `H0''` signal which is used in the counter control circuits does not come from the H-Outputs which are in the [PPU FSM](fsm.md) circuit, but is derived by the circuit which is in between the connections to the left of the sprite logic.

This special `H0''` signal (but essentially a variation of the regular H0'' signal) is marked with an arrow on the transistor circuits.

## Counters Bit

![OAM_CounterBit](/BreakingNESWiki/imgstore/ppu/OAM_CounterBit.png)

A typical counter bit circuit is used, with one exception: it is possible to "block" the counting (`BlockCount`). 

This feature is used only for bits 0 and 1 of the main counter in order to implement the modulo +4 counting mode. But blocking the count for the lower bits causes the internal carry chain to stop working for them, so an external carry chain for bits 2-7 is added to the circuit and used in Mode4.

## OAM Address

## Comparator

![oam_cmpr](/BreakingNESWiki/imgstore/ppu/oam_cmpr.jpg)

![OAM_CmpBitPair](/BreakingNESWiki/imgstore/ppu/OAM_CmpBitPair.png)

The even and odd bits of the comparator are combined into a single circuit, to compact the inverted carry chain. Between "duplets" the carry chain is kept in direct logic.

Since the circuit is essentially a subtractor, it is more appropriate to say "borrow" instead of "carry", but the phrase "borrow chain" is not commonly used, so "carry chain" is used.

The opening transistors for the input latches are next to the OAM Buffer:

## Comparison Control

![OAM_EvalFSM](/BreakingNESWiki/imgstore/ppu/OAM_EvalFSM.png)

The nor+mux+FF arrangement is actually a Posedge DFFE. And the `#EN` (enable) input is in inverse logic.

![PosedgeDFFE](/BreakingNESWiki/imgstore/ppu/PosedgeDFFE.png)

:warning: Note that this circuit uses "Other /PCLK" (`/PCLK2`) instead of the usual `/PCLK`, which is obtained locally.
Practice and simulations have shown that such "Other CLKs" are important for the correct operation of the circuit.
In this case, this signal means that places where `/PCLK2` applies are triggered slightly later than other places where regular `/PCLK` applies.

## PD/FIFO

This signal is needed when PAR/O is active. At other times it does not have any effect. The meaning of this signal is to prohibit loading sprite comparison artifact into FIFO, provided that the sprites are less than 8, or sprites for the current line were not found. This artifact appears because of the simplified circuit of copying sprites from OAM to OAM2, because the write signal is active even if the copying has not begun. This cell gets the last value from memory when comparing sprites. 

In other words, if PD/FIFO = 1, then loading the pattern from PD (H. INV) is allowed, 0 is not allowed.

## Big Capacitor ("BigCap")

The `DO_COPY` signal is connected to a large capacitor, one lining of which is made of a piece of polysilicon and the other is the chip substrate (ground). This capacitor is needed to slightly delay the edge of the `DO_COPY` signal.
